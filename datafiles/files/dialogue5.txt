1
Al: I think we may have gotten a little side tracked. What were we doing, again?
2
Frida: We have to get into Eladar Manta.
3
Al: And has all this adventuring brought us any closer to doing that?
4
Frida: Well...
5
Eric: We have three of these pointy things. Maybe that's what we need?
6
Mary: Why don't we ask Elk?
7
Frida: I guess it's worth a try.
8
Eric: He's probably in the library back in Lon Hirodine. Let's go there.
9
Frida: Excuse me, Mr. Elk?
10
Elk: Hm? You're back? Have you gone to Eladar Manta already?
11
Eric: No, they won't let us in.
12
Mary: But we found three pointy things!
13
Elk: I beg your pardon?
14
Eric: She's talking about these.
15
Eric shows Elk the Thorns.
16
Elk: Let me see those.
17
...
18
Elk: By Barnabus's beard, you've found three Thorns of Benelohim?
19
Eric: Is that what those are?
20
Elk: Indeed. The thorns which once pierced the flesh of the Son of God...
21
One of these will surely prove adequate to admit the holder to Eladar Manta.
22
Al: Then what are we waiting for? We did it! Let's get going!
23
Frida: Not so fast. Isn't there something you're missing about that?
24
Eric: There's four of us, and...
25
Mary: One. Two. Three.
26
Three thorns.
27
Al: What!? That can't be what stops us! We already went to all that trouble to get three of the things!
28
Can't we just... have three of us go in and one of us... throw a thorn out for the last person?
29
Frida: How would that even work?
30
Al: You know... through the window, or something!
31
Eric: I think we'd better play by the rules on this one. And no one's getting left behind.
32
So we'll just have to find another.
33
Frida: Argh! We nearly got killed on the first three!
34
And what are the odds that one'll turn up, anyway?
35
Mary: Hey Mr. Elk, what's down here?
36
Elk: That goes to the archives. It's no place for children.
37
Al: How come?
38
Elk: It has become infested with monstrous spirits and undead creatures. Stay away.
39
Al: Okay. Whatever you say.
40
Hmhmhm...
41
Al: Okay, he's distracted, let's go.
42
Frida: Go? Go where?
43
Al: Down to the archives.
44
Frida: But Elk told us not to go there!
45
Mary: Yeah, and you agreed with him.
46
Al: C'mon, Mary. Don't be naive. There has to be something down there worth finding!
47
Frida: Like what, books?
48
Al: You love books!
49
Eric: We could find a Thorn of Benelohim down there.
50
Frida: If there is one, it belongs to the library!
51
Al: We can borrow it for awhile. No one goes down there, anyway. It's not like they'll notice.
52
Mary: Let's go! Treasure hunt!
53
Eric: We have to hurry.
54
Frida: Ugh.
55
Mary: Phew...
56
Al: It was tough just getting down here. I hope we can get back out.
57
Eric: But where are we?
58
It feels like no one's been here in a really long time.
59
Frida: I remember reading somewhere that when the Magusite church came to power, they reserved space in various libraries for their archives.
60
But that was hundreds of years ago, and most of those archives have been lost.
61
Al: That's perfect! If we're gonna find one of those thorns anywhere, it's gonna be here.
62
Eric: Let's look around. Even if we don't find a thorn, one of these books may tell us where to find one.
63
Al: Let's not waste time then, everyone grab a book.
64
Al's Book
65
Al: I think mine is about a war...
66
It says, 'In 202, the Archmagus Ecclesiastes initiated the final battle in the siege of the Phan-da-ran-ian citadel. We've decided to rename it to Eladar Manta.'
67
Who's the Archmagus?
68
Frida: He's the leader of the Magi.
69
Al: Who are...?
70
Frida: Ugh, how can you not know? There are nine magi. They're the highest religious authority in the Magusite church.
71
That's why we're called Magusites, 'cause we believe in the divine inspiration of the Magi.
72
Al: I guess I get it. So who are the Phandaranians?
73
Frida: They were an ancient religion. They basically worshipped the devil, which is why the Magi wanted to take them over.
74
Or that's what I've heard, at least.
75
Al: Crazy...
76
Eric's book:
77
Eric: Hey, I think this is a book of poetry.
78
Let me read one...
79
"To the gates of High Heaven,
80
The hallowed courts of El.
81
We pray from our souls for
82
Our deliverance from Hell.
83
But never can we go,
84
We cannot succumb.
85
'Til our land is ours again,
86
To Chryse we come."
87
Frida: It's pronounced "Cry-Sea." The land of gold.
88
Eric: Oh.
89
Frida: Chryse is the holy land. It's the place where God's chosen people are from.
90
All of us here in Elta are said to be descended from the people of Chryse.
91
Eric: But this poem... it says Chryse belongs to someone else.
92
Frida: Yeah. It was taken over by Amharra.
93
Al: Say what? That's where I'm from!
94
Frida: Yeah. And you're not one of God's chosen people. No matter what they'll tell you.
95
Al: Fine. God's never done anything for me, anyway. I don't really care what He thinks.
96
Frida: What!? You should be thankful every day for the gifts that God's given you!
97
Eric: Can we get off the politics? We're all on the same side!
98
Frida: Al, I'm gonna pray for you.
99
Al: Oh, shut up.
100
Mary's book:
101
Frida: Mary, you've been on the same page for a long time.
102
Mary: Oh.
103
Eric: And that book looks really hard for someone your age.
104
Mary: Oh.
105
Al: And...
106
It's upside down!
107
Mary: Urk!
108
Frida: What's wrong with you!? What have you been doing this whole time?
109
Mary: Well, you see...
110
Al: You don't have to say it. I know what's going on.
111
You can't read, can you, Mary?
112
Mary: That's rude, Al! I'm surprised at you!
113
Saying something like that about me! I never!
114
Eric: Well, CAN you read?
115
Mary: ...
116
...
117
...
118
No.
119
Frida: Wow. I knew you were dumb, but that's just sad.
120
I feel bad. I really do.
121
Mary: I'm sorry... I didn't want you to find out...
122
Eric: You thought you could hide it?
123
Mary: Yeah. What choice did I have?
124
Eric: You should let us know. Even if it's something embarrassing, we won't judge you for it-
125
Er, you can just tell me, if you want.
126
Al: Besides, Mary, you're an open book. You can't hide anything from us. Not even your bedwetting problem.
127
Mary: What!?
128
Eric: Why don't you just look around, and see if you can find anything...
129
Non-literary.
130
Mary: *sniff* okay.
131
Mary walks off.
132
Eric: What was that book about, anyway?
133
Frida: It's a... cookbook.
134
Al: She'd've loved it.
135
After all that:
136
Frida: Wait... I think this book is written in some sort of code.
137
Maybe I can decipher it...
138
Frida: It's all about where the church hid their artifacts.
139
Eric: Okay, so flip to 't' for thorns.
140
Frida: It may not be that simple...
141
Frida: Please please please...
142
Aha! Right here!
143
The only one in Elta is in the catacombs of Ridania.
144
You're lucky you had someone as smart as me to figure that out.
145
Eric: I've heard of that. It's a ruin, isn't it?
146
Frida: It is now, but at the time it was a huge city.
147
It's located south of El Trice, beyond the mountains.
148
Hopefully no one beat us to it.
149
Eric: There's no time to waste, then. Let's get moving.
150
Eric: We actually found it...
151
Mary: Umm... Why are we here again?
152
Frida: There's a Thorn of Benelohim hidden here somewhere. Or...
153
There used to be, at least.
154
Al: Hey, there's already people here.
155
Eric: Hello?
156
Archeologist: Gooday, lad. Can we help yah?
157
Al: What are you doing here? This place is a ruin.
158
Archeologist: Precisely! We're here to excavate and find the hidden relics of the old church.
159
Eric: That sounds like what we're here to do.
160
Frida: Then we'll have to hurry and find the thorn before them.
161
???: Fat chance.
162
If you're here for the Thorn of Benelohim, you're outta luck.
163
Al: Says who?
164
Clarence: Says Clarence, son of Cameron.
165
Religious history prodigy.
166
Frida: We need that thorn.
167
Clarence: Church artifacts aren't toys for children to play with. Once I have the thorn, I'm taking it back to Eladar Manta, where it'll be safe from graverobbers like you.
168
Eric: So you know where the thorn is?
169
Al: And what do you mean children? You're no older than us!
170
Clarence: It's somewhere in the catacomb, which has just been unearthed
171
Mary: Over there?
172
Clarence: Yup.
173
Mary: Finders keepers!
174
Eric: Is this the end?
175
Mary: I think this is a door...
176
Al: The thorn must be on the other side.
177
Frida: It's a puzzle. Look at these sliding rings. They correspond to days, months, and years.
178
This relief must have something to do with it...
179
Al: It's a man being crowned king.
180
And there's... a guy above him.
181
Frida: I think it depicts the Crowning of King Sanones.
182
This took place on a very important date 2216 years before the birth of Benelohim. I'll just set it to that date, and...
183
...
184
Mary: What happened?
185
Al: Nothing. Frida's brain is on the fritz.
186
Frida: No! This thing must be broken.
187
Clarence: As if.
188
Clarence walks into the room.
189
I didn't chase you because I knew you'd get stuck here. 
190
These tests were always placed at the locations of important treasures, to ensure only the truly devout could get inside.
191
Frida: I already solved it. The mechanism must be broken.
192
Clarence: The Crowning of Sanones...
193
And you put in the date of that? That wouldn't be nearly hard enough.
194
Frida: What, do you have a better idea?
195
Clarence: Of course. The Crowning of Sanones is an event from the Old Book.
196
Frida: Duh.
197
Clarence: Do you know what typology is, little girl?
198
Frida: Sure I do! It's when something in the Old Book foreshadows something in the New Book.
199
Clarence: Very good! And what New Book story is typologically related to the Crowning of Sanones?
200
Frida: It's a-
201
Uh...
202
Clarence: Tsk tsk tsk. Looks like someone didn't pay attention in Sunday school.
203
It must be referring to the resurrection. Three days after the execution of Benelohim, he rose from his grave and ascended to High Heaven.
204
Tell me what day this is, girly.
205
Frida: That's easy! It's still a holiday!
206
It's uh... the first Sunday after the first full moon of Spring.
207
Clarence: And what date was that in the year 41?
208
Frida: Umm... Lemme think...
209
Clarence: I hardly blame you for not knowing. You would even have to take into account the reconstruction of the calendar in 477.
210
Clarence enters the date, and the door slides open.
211
Now then, it's as you said.
212
Finders keepers.
213
Clarence got the Thorn of Benelohim...
214
Clarence: At last, the final Thorn of Benelohim is accounted for.
215
Ciao.
216
Al: Did he say... the final?
217
Eric: So there aren't any more to find...
218
Mary: Oh...
219
What do we do now?
220
Eric: You okay, Frida?
221
Frida: Grrrr...
222
Who... who does he think he is?
223
Eric: Clarence?
224
Al: That guy's worse than you, Frida.
225
Still, you gotta admit, he knows his stuff.
226
Frida: How... can anyone be that much smarter than me...
227
It's not possible!
228
Al: Wow, Frida, you're actually crying over not being the world's biggest nerd?
229
Frida: Waah!
230
Eric: *sigh* Let's go.
231
The next day...
232
Frida: How do you know how to fish?
233
Mary: Eric taught me.
234
Frida: How many fish have you caught?
235
Mary: None.
236
Frida: You've been sitting here for hours and you haven't caught anything? Why are you still doing it?
237
Mary: I dunno. 'Cause it's fun, I guess.
238
Frida sits down next to Mary.
239
Frida: That's all? 'Cause it's fun?
240
Mary: Yup.
241
Wanna try?
242
Frida: I don't fish.
243
Mary: Just hold the pole.
244
Mary hands the pole to Frida.
245
Mary: Now just sit there.
246
They sit there for a long time. Eventually, Mary puts her head on Frida's shoulder. The scene starts to fade out, implying the end of the quest, but then Mary remembers something.
247
Mary: Oh! I almost forgot!
248
Surprise!
249
Frida: This is... a Thorn of Benelohim!
250
Mary: The last one!
251
Frida: Where did you get it?
252
Mary: From Clarence.
253
Frida: How!?
254
Mary: It went something like this...
255
I went to where they were camping later that day. I was gonna try and steal it, but they saw me.
256
So instead I just walked up to Clarence and asked nicely for it. Worth a try, ya know?
257
I expected him to spit on me or call me an egg or something, but he was actually really nice.
258
He said, 'What was the name of that girl you were with? The smart one.'
259
I told him and then he said something like, 'What a beautiful name,' and he turned all red.
260
Frida: Where is this going?
261
Mary: I kinda told him that if he gave me the thorn, you would go on a date with him.
262
Frida: YOU WHAT!?
263
Mary: I thought it was a good deal.
264
Frida: Mary, I can't do that, I'm engaged!
265
Mary: Oh, well. What's he gonna do, fight us?
266
Frida: That's so wrong...
267
Mary: But now we can go to that place.
268
Frida: To Eladar Manta.
269
Guard: Who goes-
270
Oh, it's you again.
271
Al: That's right. And this time, you're letting us in.
272
Read 'em and weep.
273
Al shows a handful of thorns.
274
Guard: Ah! Astonishing!
275
Eric: Yup. A thorn for each of us. Not bad, huh?
276
Guard: God has smiled on you. Enter, but be humble.
277
Mary: Hooray!
278
Mary: Mr. Elk!
279
Frida: Mary, be quiet. That's very disrespectful.
280
Elk: Here, I am not called Elk, young lady.
281
Eric: So what should we call you?
282
Elk: If you are feeling proper, call me Your Holiness.
283
But you can call me Adam.
284
Eric: Wait, I know that name...
285
You're the Archmagus!
286
Adam: Indeed, I am the highest religious authority in Elta.
287
But today, it is I who must be humble to you.
288
Al: Why's that?
289
Adam: When we first met, I was dismissive to you. I saw you only as children with ambitions far too lofty for your stature.
290
But the fact that you've collected four Thorns of Benelohim... 
291
To find even one exceeds my expectations most distantly.
292
Al: You wouldn't believe everything we went through...
293
???: I'm certain I wouldn't.
294
Siegfried enters from the south.
295
Mary: Gya! W-w-who are you?
296
???: Have you made it all the way here without knowing your hosts, little lady?
297
I am Magus Siegfried.
298
Frida: I am humbled to meet you, m'lord.
299
Siegfried: To your feet, young one. You must be Frida.
300
Frida: Y-yes.
301
Mary: Are you okay, Mr. Siegfried? Y-your face...
302
Siegfried: My face was weathered by the trials I faced during my passion.
303
I was liberated from my suffering only by devoting myself completely to God.
304
Adam: Please don't scare them.
305
These children have come for counsel.
306
Siegfried: Ah, yes. Frederik and Patrice. They are your parents, no, Frida?
307
Frida: Yes, they are.
308
Siegfried: I understand they are presently held in chains by the Lord's Army.
309
Frida: That's right. It was me they were after.
310
Siegfried: All those who pervert the message of God are enemies of the Magi.
311
Adam: We are already working on unravelling their secrets and recovering their prisoners.
312
What these children need is sanctuary, and they will find it here.
313
Siegfried: Tell me, Frida, and her friends as well...
314
What is it you want?
315
Eric: I am Eric, Son of Ulrich. And I promised Frida that I'd help find her parents.
316
I also promised I would find homes for Al and Mary.
317
So I don't want sanctuary... I want to keep fighting.
318
Siegfried: Your devotion is admirable. And you found not one but four thorns of Benelohim, is that correct?
319
Al: It sure is!
320
Siegfried: I think the talents of these children are wasted behind these walls.
321
They should be on the front lines of the battle.
322
In Balashtar.
323
Adam: That is folly! What if they were to meet with harm!?
324
Siegfried: They have already faced great danger and prevailed. I have no doubt they can endure whatever awaits them.
325
Adam: Groan...
326
Al: Don't worry, old dude! We'll be fine.
327
Siegfried: The Lord's Army is headquartered somewhere in Balashtar.
328
It is there that the battle against them will be decided.
329
Eric: We'll do it.
330
Mary: What's Balashtar?
331
Frida: It's the kingdom to the east of Elta. Historically, they are an ally, but recently they've become isolationists, and difficult to contact.
332
We'll have to cross the Great Bridge of Vanandel.
333
Adam: Because of their isolationism, we know little of how their battle against the Lord's Army progresses, but I would place a great wager that you will find allies amongst her people.
334
Siegfried: Make haste, children. Destiny awaits.
335
Eric: This way goes out of Elta. We should turn back.
