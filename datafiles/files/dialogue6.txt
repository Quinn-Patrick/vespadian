Eric: Wait! We're not alone.
2
Frida: It can't be...
3
Al: The Lord's Army! Those slime!
4
Eric: Quick, let's turn around before they notice us.
5
Cadet: Too late, small fry.
6
Private: Why should we pick on them?
7
Cadet: The Lord and Lady told us no one gets through here.
8
And anyone who tries is to meet with them personally.
9
Al: Nobody panic. Just play it cool.
10
Private: Say hello to the Lord of Might and the Lady of Death
11
Cadet: M'Lord, these ones were trying to cross.
12
Private: They just look like kids to me. Shall we release them back into Elta?
13
Lord: A humane proposition...
14
Lady of Death: However.
15
These aren't just any children.
16
Frida: *That voice! I remember! She was with the men who came to my house!*
17
Eric: *What!? What should we do?*
18
Lady of Death: Little Frida. You look tougher than the last time I saw you.
19
Al: You've mistaken us for someone else, it seems. That's not her name.
20
Lady of Death: Haha! Nice try, Alamand of Amharra.
21
Lord of Might: Your little band of misfits isn't exactly inconspicuous.
22
We've got orders to bring you in, and we intend to follow them.
23
Al: Wait! This is clearly a misunderstanding!
24
Eric: We should surrender. There're way too many...
25
Mary: No, Eric!
26
Eric: Hm?
27
Mary: Oh... Maybe you forgot...
28
But I haven't stopped thinking about it.
29
Frida: Eric...
30
You promised.
31
A long pause as the Lord's Army closes in. Finally, Eric draws his sword.
32
Eric: Thanks, guys...
33
I... I guess I did forget.
34
Lady of Death: We've got ourselves a fighter.
35
Lord of Might: Shall we show them our power?
36
Lady of Death: P'shaw! You'll spoil them!
37
Let me have this one.
38
Lord of Might: Very well. You have a finer touch than I, I admit.
39
Lady of Death: Yes! Get ready!
40
Upon beating the Lady in battle:
41
Lady of Death: Yowch! They're tougher than they look!
42
Lord of Might: Get real. They're only children.
43
Lady of Death: They had me going with their cute looks.
44
I won't let my guard down again.
45
Frida: It's hopeless... we can't even beat one of them...
46
Eric: No...
47
???: I've seen enough.
48
Mary: Wha-?
49
Covered head to toe in black armor, every part of him obscured, the Lord's Knight enters the scene.
50
???: Cease this foolishness.
51
Lady of Death: Urgh! Mind your business!
52
Lord of Might: Do not dare use such a tone with the Lord's Knight!
53
Apologies, Sir Knight. What would you have us do?
54
Knight: Let them go.
55
Lord of Might: Y-you...
56
With all due respect, you can't be serious. We have orders to-
57
Knight: I said let them go!
58
I admire the strength of these young warriors. Their tenacity.
59
One day they will see the light.
60
But it will never reach them through the haze of your cruelty.
61
It's embarrassing that I even have to explain this to you.
62
Lord of Might: A-Apologies.
63
We will let them through.
64
Knight: Good. I won't hear another word of it.
65
The Lord's Knight walks off.
66
Lady of Death: I've had it with him being the boss's favorite.
67
Lord of Might: We must follow his orders.
68
Lady of Death: Still. We can't have these brats thinking they're in charge.
69
What if we just...
70
Took one of them?
71
Lord of Might: That sounds fair.
72
Al: Hey wait! But he said!
73
Lady: This one looks cute! I choose her!
74
Mary: Agh! Lemme go!
75
The Lady grabs Mary by her coat, and rides off with the Lord on horseback. The rest of the squad follows, leaving the party in the dust.
76
Eric: MARY!!
77
Al: Oh, God, no...
78
Eric: Hurry! We have to go after them!
79
Frida: Ahh... Mary...
80
And that was how it happened...
81
So what awaits our heroes in Balashtar?
82
What will be Mary's fate in the hands of the Lord's Army?
83
And just who are these villains, shrouded in as much enigma as malice?
84
As hope for their quest dwindles, keep your eyes and ears open for the next chapter in the story.
