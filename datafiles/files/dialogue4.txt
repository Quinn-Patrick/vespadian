Al: Where are we now?
2
Eric: We've just made it to Port Town.
3
It's a port... town.
4
Al: Always creative naming.
5
Frida: My parents used to take me here when they would come to meet diplomats and the like.
6
I always love watching the ships come in and out. So romantic...
7
I just wish Hector was here.
8
Al: Who?
9
Frida: Hector is my fiance. We're going to get married when I turn 16.
10
Al: Oho! You jealous, Eric?
11
Eric: N-no! Hector is a good friend of mine from the knight academy. I respect him a lot.
12
Frida: You should follow my example, Mary.
13
Mary: Hm?
14
Frida: Learn to be a proper lady, and one day maybe a nice boy will want to marry you, too.
15
Mary: A boy?
16
Uh... I dunno...
17
Frida: Hmph! Well if you ever want to go anywhere in the world, you'll need to find a husband.
18
Mary: Really? O-Okay...
19
Eric: *gasp*
20
Mary: Doggies!
21
Mary runs up to pet the dogs.
22
Frida: Mary! You have to ask permission first!
23
I'm sorry for her, sir.
24
???: Don't fret, lassie. They be tamer'n lambs.
25
Mulvaney: Call me Mulvaney. Captain Mulvaney if yer feelin' proper.
26
Frida: I'm Frida, Daughter of Frederick.
27
Eric: ...
28
Al: I'm uhh... Alamand of Amharra.
29
Eric?
30
Eric: Oh. Sorry. I'm E-
31
Eric.
32
Mulvaney: And this lass be Mary, as I heard yee shoutin'.
33
Mary: Are you a pirate?
34
Mulvaney: Arg arg arr! No, I be an honest sailor.
35
And a lucky one, to be happenin' on a daughter of nobility, and an emissary of distant lands.
36
Al: Aw shucks, Captain, we're really no big deal.
37
Mulvaney: Humility be a rare trait in the youths o' today.
38
That, and me canine crew seems to've taken a likin' tah yee.
39
Fer that, I'll let you in on a sailor's secret.
40
Al: Woah, what kind of secret.
41
Mulvaney: It be... that while I be no pirate, I do have pirate's treasure.
42
Mary: Treasure?
43
Frida: Is that true?
44
Mulvaney: Aye, as true as the deep blue.
45
Al: Well don't hold out on us, where's it hidden!?
46
Mulvaney: I can't be tellin' yee that! Only me crew on the Hyperion knows where I be hidin' me treasure.
47
Argargarg!
48
Mulvaney walks off.
49
Al: Okay, let's go find out where that treasure's hidden.
50
Frida: You can't be that stupid. He was messing with us!
51
Al: C'mon, Frida, don't be such a downer. You really think he would just lie to us?
52
What do you think, Mary?
53
Mary: Umm... 
54
I believe him.
55
Frida: UGH. No one cares what Mary thinks.
56
Eric: I think... we should have a look around that ship.
57
The Hyperion, right?
58
Frida: Why is it always me against everyone?
59
First Mate: Hey! What are kids doing here?
60
Skipper: Yeah, we ain't doin' tours.
61
Mary: Busted...
62
Al: ...Hm? You're talking to us?
63
First Mate: I don't see anyone else around, do you?
64
Al: Oh, well, we're just here for a...
65
School project.
66
Skipper: A school project?
67
Al: Yeah. We're supposed to write a report on...
68
Sailing ship engineering.
69
Mary: Like, how do you keep the water out?
70
Al: Exactly. I have no idea.
71
First Mate: Well, alright, you can look around.
72
Skipper: Are you nuts? They're obviously lying!
73
Al: What? Are you accusing me?
74
Skipper: I'm just saying-
75
Al: Cause if we don't do well on this assignment... uh...
76
Then Frida will have to repeat a grade!
77
Frida: Excuse me!?
78
Al: Between you and me, she's embarrassed by her bad grades.
79
Skipper: Fine, fine. Just don't touch anything.
80
Eric: Wow, Al. That felt practiced.
81
Al: Yeah, I've done a few fake school projects in my day. Let's keep moving.
82
Mary: Fake? So Frida's not failing in school?
83
Frida: My grades are excellent!
84
Mary: That's a relief...
85
Eric: Look, a map.
86
Frida: This looks like a map of Elta. Why would they have that on a ship?
87
Don't you think they would have sea charts and stuff?
88
Al: Let's have a closer look.
89
Mary: Look! It's an 'X'!
90
Al: 'X' marks the spot!
91
Eric: It's between El Trice and Havenheit. Not far from home.
92
Frida: It must be that old shack.
93
...Not that I want to go
94
Al: Hey, here it is! It's real!!
95
Gold! Jewels! All of it!
96
Mary: We're like real pirates!
97
Al: Forget that, we're really rich!
98
Frida: Ugh, what did you do!?
99
Al: I didn't do anything! 
100
Eric: That was the only way out.
101
We're... trapped.
102
Mary: Wh-
103
What?
104
T-t-t-t-trapped?
105
Are we gonna die?
106
Eric: ...
107
Mary: *sob*
108
Frida: We've gotta find a way out.
109
Al, isn't there some spell you can use to move the rocks or something?
110
Al: Sorry, I don't know anything like that.
111
Frida: Then we really are trapped.
112
Mary: Waaaaah!
113
Al: Try to stay calm, Mary. We'll find a way out of this.
114
Frida: Eric, do something!
115
Don't forget what you said!
116
Al: Let's just... sit down and think.
117
Hours pass...
118
Al: Well, there's nothing in the treasure pile we can use.
119
Frida: It's hopeless...
120
Mary: *Whimper*
121
Al: What about you, Eric? You haven't said a thing.
122
Pregnant silence...
123
Frida: Eric!
124
Do something!
125
What happened to the way you were in the library! You stood up to a-
126
To Elk.
127
Al: She's actually right this time. And you took on a huge responsibility, there.
128
Eric: ...So?
129
Al: So c'mon! Get off your butt and get it together!
130
Eric: I'm not a miracle worker. What am I supposed to do?
131
Al: I dunno! 
132
Hey, at least I'm not afraid of dogs!
133
Eric: Urk! Wha- what are you talking about!?
134
Al: Don't be dumb. Back in Port Town. You saw those dogs coming and went white as a ghost.
135
You're as scared of dogs as Mary is of taking a bath.
136
Eric: *sob*
137
Al: Oh, and here come the waterworks. Look at the big, tough knight.
138
I can't believe it! He's supposed to be looking after us, and he's just a sniveling coward!
139
Al: Hey! Did you throw your shoe at me!?
140
Al: Wha- is that?
141
Frida: It's a scar from a dog bite.
142
Eric: When I was, I dunno, 7? Maybe 8?
143
There was this mean old man who lived near where I went to school.
144
His dog was even meaner.
145
The other boys would always bug it, but it couldn't get them 'cause there was a fence.
146
One day they lost something in the old guy's yard, and they dared me to go and get it.
147
I waited 'til the dog was asleep and hopped the fence.
148
Al: It woke up, huh?
149
Eric: Yeah. I just remember thinking I was gonna lose my whole foot, it latched on so tight...
150
After that they had the dog put down.
151
And...
152
My dad told me if the dog was rabid...
153
Then I would die, too.
154
Frida: Your own dad said that?
155
Eric: Yeah.
156
It wasn't, of course. I'm still here.
157
But... for a kid, that was basically how I learned about death as a concept.
158
So now whenever I see a dog, I just think of the way it looked at me when it woke up, and...
159
Mary: But...
160
Eric: Huh?
161
Mary: But you didn't die.
162
Eric: Well sure, but it was still scary!
163
Al: I don't think that's what she meant.
164
Frida: I get it...
165
Eric: Huh?
166
Al: I think what she means is that was one time you thought you were gonna die, but you didn't.
167
So if you can cheat death once, why not twice?
168
Eric: GYAAAAAAAAAH!
169
Al: Yes! YES!
170
I don't know how it's possible, but he's doing it!
171
Eric: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
172
Al: I can see light!
173
Frida: Don't overexert! You'll hurt yourself!
174
Al: Don't tell him that! Overexert! Exert as much as you need to!
175
Eric collapses.
176
Eric: *pant* *gasp*
177
???: Is someone in there?
178
Frida: That voice...
179
Al: Is that...
180
Mary: ...really him?
181
Mulvaney: There yee be!
182
Al: Captain!
183
Mulvaney: How long have yee been down here?
184
Frida: Days!
185
Al: About four hours.
186
Mulvaney: This hole in the rocks looks about big enough to fit yee through. Just sit tight and I'll have yee outta thar!
187
Mulvaney helps remove the party from the treasure room.
188
Mulvaney: I thought I'd find yee here after me key turned up missin'.
189
You know you shouldn't be takin' other people's things.
190
Al: Wha? But-but-but-
191
Eric: So why did you tell us about the treasure?
192
Mulvaney: To mess with yee!
193
Al: What? No! Frida can't be right!
194
Frida: You'll learn, honey. I'm always right.
195
Mulvaney: Still, I'm more than impressed that yee made it here.
196
How about this from me hoard as a token of my respect.
197
Obtained a Thorn of Benelohim!
198
Eric: Is it valuable?
199
Mulvaney: Perhaps in the right hands, aye.
200
...
201
I still be messin' wit yee! As far as I know, it be worthless!
202
Al: Aw, well. Thanks for helping us get out, Captain.
203
Mulvaney: Don't mention it.
204
As the party is about to leave the dungeon...
205
Mary: Eric.
206
Eric: Hm? What is it, Mary?
207
Mary: ...back there, you looked really...
208
...pathetic.
209
Eric: Agh! What are you trying to say!?
210
Mary: But then...
211
The way you moved those rocks was awesome.
212
Even though you were still crying.
213
Eric: ...Thanks?
214
Mary: How did you do it?
215
Eric: I guess I...
216
...saw your face after you heard my story.
217
You looked like you had hope, and I didn't want to let you down.
218
And then I just felt strong.
219
Mary: That's sweet.
220
Frida said I have to find a husband...
221
Eric: Wh-what?
222
Well, you don't have to do everything Frida says, y'know!
223
Mary: That's a relief.
224
...you're all red.
225
Did you think I was talking about you?
226
Eric: You weren't?
227
Mary: No. It was just... on my mind.
228
Eric: Oh. Okay.
229
Phew.
