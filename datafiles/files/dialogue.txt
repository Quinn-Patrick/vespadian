Has anyone leveled up yet? When you do, be sure to cash in those feats!
2
It's easy! Just press ESC to access the main menu, and scroll down to "features."
3
Select that, and pick the feat that you want. You gain one feat point to cash in for a feat every time you level up.
4
Just keep in mind that most feats require that you get an earlier feat first.
5
Some feats will even give you a bonus, where you get to choose a score to increase.
6
Do you have any abilities yet? Once you do, hit ESC to access the main menu, and scroll down to "abilities."
7
From that menu, you can select abilities to switch them on and off. You need ability points to switch them on, but for now you should have plenty.
8
You kids got money?
9
Mary: Eek! It's huge! Kill it kill it kill it kill it!
10
Eric: Gimme a break, Mary. Just remember: it's every bit as afraid of you as you are of it.
11
Alamand: That must be why it's attacking us! Heads up!!
12
Here's the basics of scores, which are different froms stats:
13
Each character has 8 scores. They are: Strength, Fortitude, Dexterity, Agility, Intellect, Wisdom, Charisma, and Spirit.
14
Strength determines damage dealt with hefty weapons like swords and hammers.
15
Fortitude determines max hit points.
16
Dexterity determines damage dealt by lightweight weapons like daggers, as well as your accuracy.
17
Agility determines your speed and evasiveness.
18
Intellect determines the power of light, vital, and psychic magic.
19
Wisdom helps you resist and inflict many effects like blindness.
20
Charisma determines the power of fire, ice, lightning, and poison magic.
21
And last up is Spirit, which determines maximum skill points.
22
Your scores also determine your stats, so keep an eye on them.
23
Sick of looking at Eric? You can press the space bar to toggle the party leader. It doesn't change anything, however.
24
I'll heal you whenever you need.
25
Don't forget to save frequently!
26
Press ESC to access the main menu, then scroll down to "save," and pick the file that you want to save to.
27
If you fall in battle, you'll have to load a saved game. You can only save in "safe" rooms like this one, however.
28
Items can save your life out there, but each of you can only carry so many.
29
While you're in a "safe" room like this one, you can press ESC to access the menu, select inventory, and select an item from stock.
30
Choose "swap" and then choose a slot in one of your personal inventories to bring it into battle.
31
While in an "unsafe" room like the one up ahead, you can only use the items in your personal inventories, so plan carefully!
32
This is some text in a cutscene.
33
Get ready for a whole heckuva lot o' this!
34
I'll give you every power.
35
I'll give you every ability.
36
I feel an encroaching darkness... I may have to fight to defend myself.
37
!!!
38
This place seems calm. I must take this chance to rest, and record my progress.
39
Care to save the game?
40
Remember, if you fall in battle, you will have to load a saved game.
41
Fully restored.
42
The dark forces grow stronger. I may need to use my powers to defeat them. I may be attacked at any time.
43
I must think carefully about which powers to use when...
44
Pressed the switch...
45
A barrier. Perhaps there is some way to open it?
46
What is this? What is happening to me? What is this place?
47
Can it... can it be?
48
Last I remember, I gazed into the mirror, with eyes still living...
49
I see now... I must be having a vision... A miracle... It's a...
50
Miracle.
51
...No!
52
Please tell me... God... what have I done to be subjected to the presence of such foul villainy...
53
Please, God, divulge Thy purporse for me today.
54
...
55
I see...
56
I shall go into battle without fear! Do not avert Thy blessed gaze, my Lord...
57
...for I shall strike a glorious victory against this foul arch-sinner in Thy name!
58
YES!!! BEHOLD MY POWER!
59
All shall fear me! Me, the great-
60
!!!
61
F-Forgive my insolence, my Lord... It is only through you that I-
62
I can...
63
...
64
I understand...
65
Thank you... for showing me this...
66
I know what I must do.
67
Frida: Ugh... this can't be happening to me.
68
???: Hey, are you okay?
69
Frida: Ack! Get away from me!
70
Eric: S-sorry! I didn't mean to scare you!
71
I just... saw you sleeping in a church. And I thought maybe you were in trouble.
72
Frida: A church?
73
It wasn't just a dream...
74
Eric: So do you need help, or...?
75
Frida: Yes! Well, I think so. Some strange men came to my house last night.
76
Actually, I think one of them might have been a woman.
77
But anyway, they were after me for some reason.
78
Mom and dad tried to protect me, and they got arrested or kidnapped or...
79
*Sob* I just don't know...
80
Eric: Wow...
81
That really happened? That's... awful.
82
Frida: So you'll help?
83
Eric: Of course! I'm not sure how much I can do, but...
84
Maybe we should exchange names first.
85
I'm Eric Son of Ulrich.
86
Frida: I'm Frida.
87
Daughter of Frederick. So you've probably heard of me.
88
Eric: ...No?
89
Unless you mean Frederick of House Tricius. But I had no idea they had a daughter.
90
Frida: !!!
91
Well it's not exactly a secret!
92
Eric: Sorry! Whadaya want me to say?
93
Frida: Hmph! Some people just have no culture.
94
Eric: Guilty as charged, I guess.
95
Eric: Any ideas on what to do?
96
Frida: What? I didn't know I was supposed to be thinking of stuff!
97
Eric: Well, I haven't thought of anythi-
98
Frida: Wait! I do have an idea! We'll go see Hector!
99
I'm a genius.
100
Eric: Wait, you mean Hector Son of Heinrich?
101
Frida: Oh, so you've heard of him but not me?
102
Eric: Nothing personal, it's just that we're both in the knight academy. He's two years above me.
103
Frida: Oh yes, he is something...
104
...
105
Eric: So how do you know him?
106
Frida: Shouldn't it be obvious? We're engaged to be married!
107
Eric: Come again!? It's not obvious at all, you don't look nearly old enough to get married!
108
Frida: Oh, don't be ridiculous. We aren't actually getting married until I turn 16.
109
I'm 14 now, of course.
110
Eric: That's still pretty young. I'm 14 too, and I can't imagine being engaged.
111
The thought of spending that much time with a girl just... freaks me out.
112
Frida: Hmph! Well get used to it, then!
113
Eric: No, I didn't mean...
114
Can we just go?
115
Frida: Fine! I hope I don't freak you out too much.
116
Eric: Ugh...
117
Buy some gear, if you think you can handle it.
118
Let me know if you need anything.
119
What, you can't even afford a room? Why don't you get a real job and come back!
120
Hector: Frida! What are you doing here? Is something wrong?
121
Frida: Umm... I'm not really sure where to begin...
122
Eric: Frida's parents were taken away by strange men late last night. They were after her, but she got away.
123
Hector: You're... Eric, right?
124
Eric: That's right.
125
Hector: Good. I can trust her with a fellow knight.
126
Eric: In training...
127
Hector: This is deeply troubling.
128
If what I suspect is true, we should plan our moves carefully.
129
I was just about to leave for school. Let me leave a note for my parents.
130
Frida: Ack! I totally forgot it was a school day!
131
Eric: Don't worry about that now! We have to get you to safety!
132
Hector: What about you, Eric? Is there anything you need to take care of before we leave?
133
Frida: Oh yeah... I hadn't even thought about you. What were you doing hanging around the church this morning, anyway?
134
Eric: Who, me? Uhh- nothing. I'm on special training. That's all. Don't worry about it.
135
...
136
...
137
Hector: I'll take you at your word. Let's be off.
138
Hector: Wait! We can't just walk out the front gates!
139
I think those men may be searching for us. We should make for the north end of El Trice. There's a gap in the wall leading out of town.
140
Frida: That goes into the woods. I was never allowed to play there as a kid because of how dangerous it was.
141
Hector: Don't worry. Eric and I can handle it.
142
Eric: Hector, earlier, you said you suspected something about this whole mess. What were you talking about?
143
Hector: I'll bet anything it's the Lord's Army.
144
Eric: Who?
145
Hector: They're some sort of militia. They wander Elta causing trouble like this, yet they always seem to get away with it.
146
They have some sort of political power. Peacekeepers always look the other way.
147
Frida: I've heard of them. They say they serve God.
148
It burns me up that they would use His name like that!
149
...but why would they be after me?
150
Eric: It could be because of who your parents are.
151
Hector: Actually, I think it's probably because of her powers.
152
Eric: Powers?
153
Frida: That's right! I happen to be quite the magical prodigy!
154
Hector: I have some magical powers myself.
155
Frida: You see? We're a perfect match!
156
Eric: I've never felt so out of place...
157
Hector: The Lord's Army seems interested in recruiting spellcasters. They already have many in their ranks.
158
Eric: You should watch your back then, Hector. They could be after you next.
159
Hector: Ha! Let them come! I'll show them a thing or two!
160
I only wish I had been there for Frida...
161
Hector: From here, we make for Havenheit in the east. Frida should be safe there.
162
I have my responsibilities in El Trice, so I'll leave her safety to you, Eric.
163
Frida: I love Havenheit. You know it's renowned for its giant theater.
164
I wish we had time to see a play...
165
Eric: You're just gonna trust me with your girlfriend like that?
166
Hector: Certainly. I have faith in your honor as a knight. Unless... there's a reason I shouldn't trust you?
167
Frida: Oh, don't worry. We have NO chemistry at all.
168
As if I would ever be interested in someone so plain.
169
And that's barely getting into everything wrong with him.
170
Hector: Be nice, Frida.
171
Frida: Come on, I'm just kidding.
172
Hector: I'm sorry I can't stay.
173
Eric: Don't worry, Hector. We'll be fine.
174
Hector: Just do your best.
175
Frida: Goodbye, Hector.
176
I love you.
177
Hector: I love you, too.
178
...
179
Eric: It's okay. We'll only be gone for a little while.
180
Frida: I know.
181
I just... got the chills for some reason.
182
It's nothing.
183
Eric: Let's have a look around town.
184
Frida: Oh! Look! Look!
185
A street performance! How fun!
186
Eric: It's just a kid...
187
Alamand: Behold the powers of Alamand! The legendary mystic!
188
Eric: The crowd's eating it up.
189
Frida: Sure they are! He's the real deal!
190
Eric: So you're saying he has real magical powers? How can you tell?
191
Frida: It must be my woman's intuition.
192
Also, those are all spells Hector can use.
193
Eric: We should be moving on.
194
Frida: Quiet! Hide!
195
Eric: What is it?
196
Frida: It's them! In the crowd! The Lord's Army!
197
No no no! How did they find me?
198
Eric: Maybe they didn't... what if it's not you they're after?
199
Frida: What do you-
200
*Gasp* I think you're right! What do we do?
201
Alamand: Hm? Fans of mine?
202
Sorry, I don't do autographs.
203
Eric: We're too late!
204
Frida: Run away, Alamand!
205
Alamand: Wh-what?
206
Lord's Army Cadet: You're coming with us, little boy.
207
Alamand: Now wait a second! Let go of me!!
208
Eric: Let's help him!
209
Alamand: Quick! This way!
210
Alamand: Thanks for the help.
211
What are your names?
212
Eric: I'm Eric, Son of Ulrich.
213
Frida: And I'm Frida, Daughter of Frederick.
214
Alamand: I didn't ask who your dads were. Eltans are so weird...
215
But you guys seem okay. You actually have your heads screwed on straight.
216
Eric: Thanks, I guess.
217
Frida: Is Alamand your real name?
218
Alamand: Of course it is! I was gonna say you can call me Al, but I don't know...
219
Al: Okay! You can call me Al if you want. As thanks for saving me.
220
And you can be my bodyguards.
221
Eric: Where are you from, Al? Since you aren't Eltan?
222
Al: I'm from Amharra.
223
Frida: Ooh! Say something in Amharran for me!
224
Al: Uhh... let's see...
225
Eric: Frida! That's rude.
226
Al: Yeah! I'm not some party trick.
227
But to be honest, I barely remember Amharra.
228
I was 3 years old when my powers manifested for the first time.
229
My parents were very poor, and they thought I could have a better chance at a good life in Elta.
230
So they stowed me away on a ship with my older cousin.
231
He actually died a few years ago. So now it's just me.
232
Good thing the owner of the theater is nice enough to let me squat here.
233
Frida: What a sad story.
234
Eric: Do you ever feel like going back to Amharra?
235
Al: No.
236
Frida: Why not? Don't you want to see your home?
237
Al: I don't have any idea what it's like there.
238
And I...
239
...I don't really want my family to see me.
240
Frida: You don't want to see your family? What are you saying?
241
Al: Can we talk about something else?
242
Eric: Does the owner of the theater take care of you?
243
Al: No. Sometimes he'll bring me something to eat, but I'm mostly on my own.
244
I'm 13. I'm old enough to take care of myself.
245
Besides, those street shows make more money than you'd think.
246
Eltans are rubes. I just have to look mysterious and exotic, and they'll empty their pockets.
247
Frida: Don't you go to school? You're not a delinquent, are you?
248
Al: No. What's school good for, anyway?
249
I learned to read and write from play scripts. What else do I need?
250
Frida: What else do you need!? What about chemistry, geology, geography, uh...
251
Biology...
252
Al: I don't even know what most of those words mean, and I'm doing just fine.
253
All I need is a stupid costume and some flashy powers.
254
Frida: The poison of anti-intellectualism runs deep in today's youth...
255
Al: By the way, who were those guys outside?
256
Eric: The Lord's Army. They abducted Frida's parents. That's why we came here from El Trice.
257
Al: Okay. But who ARE they?
258
Frida: No one's really sure. But they have influence. And they're interested in spellcasters.
259
Eric: You should come with us. We're trying to find a safe place for Frida. And then find a way to get her parents back.
260
Frida: What!? I never said he could come with us!
261
Al: Thanks but...
262
I'm not going anywhere. I'll just hide out in here until this blows over.
263
Not like I have anywhere better to go.
264
Eric: I feel terrible leaving you here when you could be in danger.
265
But I guess I can't force you to come.
266
Frida: Is anybody even listening to me?
267
Wait...
268
Do you guys smell that?
269
Eric: Yeah. It's like...
270
Al: Smoke.
271
Frida: FIRE!
272
Al: What!? How did this happen?
273
Eric: Could it be the Lord's Army?
274
Al: Those-
275
AAAAARGH! HOW COULD THEY!?
276
Frida: We have to get out of here!
277
Al: This way! Quick!
278
Man: Hey! There he is! That freak kid!
279
Woman: It must've been him! He's always playing with fire!
280
Al: They... they think I...
281
Eric: It wasn't him! We were with him the whole time! It wasn't him!!
282
Frida: We should skip town.
283
Al: I didn't do it... *sob* I didn't do it... *hic* I swear I- *sob* I didn't do it...
284
Lord's Army Cadet: Is that them? Over there!
285
Eric: We have to go now!
286
Eric: I thought they just had an overly-aggressive recruitment program, but...
287
...back there it was like they were trying to kill you.
288
Al: ...
289
Frida: At least say thank you.
290
Al: ...what did you say?
291
Frida: Nothing. Just that I, a member of high society, just selflessly put my freedom on the line to save you, a grifting street urchin.
292
I expect a little gratitude.
293
Eric: Frida, try to be sensitive-
294
Al: Shut up, Eric! I can fight my own battles.
295
And as for you, princess.
296
In case you haven't noticed, mommy and daddy aren't here to give you your allowance.
297
So until you get a job, or slay a dragon, YOU are the grifting street urchin, NOT me.
298
And YOU are the one who owes a thank you to that spineless jellyfish over there, for having the patience of a saint, and tolerating you long enough to make sure you don't get eaten by wolves!
299
Frida: ...
300
Al: ...
301
Frida: ...
302
Al: ...
303
Frida: ...
304
Frida: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!
305
ERIC HOW CAN YOU LET HIM SAY THINGS LIKE THAT?
306
Eric: Spineless...
307
Al: Can it, you prissy piece of work!
308
Eric: Would everyone just...
309
Frida: YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY! I'LL TELL MY DAD! HE'LL... HE'LL...
310
Eric: Would you two please...
311
Al: Oh by all means! Go and get him! I'll wait right here!
312
Eric: SHUT UP! BOTH OF YOU!
313
Al: ...
314
Frida: *sniff* Wow Eric, don't fly off the handle.
315
Eric: Can we all just calm down?
316
We can't let ourselves get torn apart.
317
You both have powerful people out trying to hurt you! Or did you forget?
318
Al: ...
319
Frida: ...
320
Eric: If we don't stick together, they'll get you for sure!
321
Al: *sob* Fine...
322
Frida: ...
323
Eric: Good. Now let's get some rest.
324
Eric: 'Morning, Al.
325
...
326
You look terrible.
327
Al: Thanks.
328
Eric: Didn't you sleep at all?
329
Al: Are you gonna wake up Frida?
330
Frida: Nng... I'm awake.
331
Al: Don't let us stop you from sleeping in. We don't even know where we're going.
332
Frida: For your information, I'm ten times the morning person you will ever be.
333
Eric: We're going to Lon Hirodine.
334
Frida: The capital. Are you sure that's a good idea? Won't they look there?
335
Eric: It's the only way out of central Elta. Plus, we'll have an easier time blending in to a city with lots of people.
336
Al: Sounds good enough for me.
337
Hector: We don't have time for detours. We need to get to Havenheit.
338
Frida: *sigh* The big city...
339
Al: These big crowds make me nervous now. What if we were followed?
340
Eric: Then they'll give us a better chance of getting away.
341
Frida: I'm exhausted... can we go to the inn, already?
342
Al: What!? We just got here!
343
Eric: I think Frida's right. It's been a long couple of days.
344
Al: Fine. Whatever.
345
Can't press it again...
346
Speak to me Lord, I humbly ask.
347
Divulge your will unto me, and it shall be done.
348
That, I promise.
349
Pressed the switch...
350
You can hear the water draining.
351
Pressed the switch...
352
You can hear the water rising.
