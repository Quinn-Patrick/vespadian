Eric: This seems like a good place to make camp.
2
They won't think to look in the mountains.
3
Frida: Finally. I'm so tired...
4
So no one had better wake me up!
5
Late that night...
6
Mary: EVERYONE WAKE UUUUUP!
7
Eric: Wha-wh-wha-
8
What is it?
9
Frida: That does it, Mary, I am officially never praying for you again. I told you not to wake me up!
10
Mary: But it's important! I saw something!
11
Eric: Was it the Lord's Army?
12
Al: Oh man, do we have to leave?
13
Mary: No, it was something up the mountain.
14
Eric: What? Are we in danger?
15
Mary: Umm...
16
I dunno.
17
Frida: Please just go to sleep.
18
Eric: Okay, Mary, tell me about what you saw.
19
Mary: It was a huuuuuge man. He was really hairy. He looked out from behind a rock and ran away up the mountain.
20
I think he saw us and got scared.
21
Al: What? A huge, hairy, mountain-dwelling man?
22
There's only one thing that could be.
23
Frida: Please stop talking...
24
Al: An ape man!
25
Eric: An ape man?
26
Al: Yeah, you know.
27
A yeti. A sasquatch. They love mountains.
28
Frida: UGH. There's no such thing as ape men! Now go back to sleep!!
29
Al: Really, Frida? We live in a world full of ghosts, slime monsters, and probably dragons, but you draw the line at ape men?
30
Eric: He has a point. Magic is definitely real, too.
31
Frida: Fine. Whatever you say. Ape men are real, and one is stalking us. I'd still rather get eaten in my sleep than while I'm still awake.
32
Eric: There's not much we can do about it tonight, anyway. Let's rest up.
33
Al: Argh, how can I sleep knowing the discovery we're about to make?
34
Frida: Figure it out.
35
The next morning...
36
Eric: Ugh... what are you two doing up so early?
37
Al: We're making preparations to hunt the ape man.
38
Mary: Time to claim our place in history!
39
Frida: No way, we aren't hunting anything!
40
Eric: It does seem... poorly thought out.
41
Al: Think about it. What did that guy at Eladar-whatever say?
42
Something about faith, and finding tokens of our worth?
43
Maybe you both should have some faith in Mary and I.
44
Mary: Yeah!
45
Eric: Maybe... we'll find one of those tokens up the mountain.
46
Frida: Ungh...
47
Frida: How much higher are we gonna go? It's freezing!
48
Al: We c-c-c-can't stop now! We haven't f-f-f-found the ape man yet!
49
Frida: There's nothing here! This was a waste of time!
50
Mary: Eric... I don't feel good...
51
Eric: The altitude is too much for Mary. We have to turn back.
52
Al: C-c-c'mon! T-t-this is our chance! We c-c-c-can't blow it!
53
Eric: Use your head, Al! Some stupid monster isn't worth this!
54
Al: Worth what? You're okay, right Mary? Just tell 'em!
55
Mary: I... I think I'm gonna...
56
*blech*
57
Frida: Gross!
58
Al: Okay, maybe we should turn back.
59
Mary: Ohh, that's so much better...
60
Eric: Hold still, let me wipe your face.
61
Frida: We're still turning back.
62
Eric: I agree. Let's not waste any more daylight.
63
Al: Did you hear that? I don't think we're alone here...
64
Mary: AAAAAAAAAAH! IT'S THE APE MAN!
65
Eric: Al? Weren't you gonna fight it or something?
66
Al: I-I-I-I uhhh I uh-
67
Frida: Don't soil yourself. He's not a monster.
68
???: Do I hear you correctly? You have come here hunting an ape man?
69
If this is how you speak of my people, I can be as much a monster as you like.
70
But you four look meek, even for humans.
71
Eric: This is a misunderstanding, I swear!
72
Al just got this idea in his head, so we started climbing the mountain.
73
???: I see I have nothing to fear from you, ignorant though you may be.
74
I am Vitruvius.
75
Frida: I'm Frida, nice to meet you.
76
He's a Balophim. Eltans call them Woolymen.
77
Eric: I'm Eric. He's Al, and she's Mary.
78
Mary: Hubububu-hububu-
79
Frida: Quit stammering, Mary.
80
Eric: I had know idea anyone lived up here.
81
Vitruvius: Only those with the fortitude to brave the mountain know of our existence.
82
So we remain... obscure.
83
But I can see that you have strength beyond your size.
84
Come with me, and you may have warmth and rest.
85
Eric: Hey, is it warmer here?
86
Frida: Yeah, but only a little. That's weird.
87
Al: You guys, too? Good, I thought I was about to die.
88
Vitruvius: My son Linus left the village a while back in an act of rebellion. Until he returns, you can sleep in his quarters.
89
Frida: Thank you very much.
90
Al: No offence, chief, but what's the catch?
91
Vitruvius: Humans are so cynical.
92
But you're right. I have something to ask of you.
93
Eric: Go on, we owe you.
94
Vitruvius: You already noticed the supernatural warmth in our village.
95
It keeps us alive, for even we would succumb to the bitter cold without it.
96
Mary: Even with all that hair?
97
Vitruvius: The warmth is given to us by the dragon Valamus.
98
Frida: Wait, dragons are real?
99
Al: Frida, we've been over this.
100
Vitruvius: Valamus normally lives in his temple, receiving our offerings.
101
He is benevolent and beloved.
102
But recently...
103
Eric: Something happened to him?
104
Vitruvius: He withdrew into the catacombs of the temple. Since doing so, his heat has waned.
105
What's worse is, it would seem that he deliberately caused a rockslide to seal himself within.
106
There is an opening, but it is too small for us.
107
Al: But you think we can fit?
108
Vitruvius: Precisely.
109
Be cautious. The catacombs are known to be dangerous.
110
Eric: We'll see what we can do.
111
Frida: This looks like a safe place to rest.
112
Eric: It's so warm. After how cold the mountain was, I never thought I'd sweat again.
113
Frida: And now that we're alone, we can address the elephant in the room.
114
Eric: Elephant?
115
Al: What are you talking about?
116
Frida: Don't play dumb, Al.
117
Al: Wait, are you mad at me?
118
Frida: No, I'm just curious as to why you would risk MY safety just to find some dumb monster.
119
Eric: Mary, too. She said how sick she felt, and you still insisted on climbing.
120
Al: Wha- that's not...
121
Mary: I'm okay, guys...
122
Frida: You're lucky Vitruivius came along, or we could've died!
123
Not to mention that it was your idea in the first place! As if you know anything about climbing mountains!
124
Al: Shut up! Just lay off me, okay!?
125
Eric: We just want to know why this mattered so much to you.
126
Al: You...
127
Frida: We what!?
128
Al: You don't understand what it's like to be me!
129
Frida: You're not making any sense! No one knows what you're talking about!
130
Al: Then shut up and let me talk!
131
My parents were very, very poor.
132
When they found out about my powers, they sent me to Elta so that...
133
Frida: We know that already. You told us that and it doesn't excuse anything.
134
Mary: I didn't know that.
135
Al: They sent me to Elta because they thought here I could live a better life.
136
They thought I would have the chance to do great things. And make them proud.
137
I have certain expectations to live up to.
138
And right now I'm just...
139
...lost and homeless and leeching off my friends.
140
I thought maybe I could at least be the guy who discovered the ape man.
141
...Okay that sounds pretty stupid out loud, but...
142
...I really had a chance.
143
Eric: And you would risk anything for it?
144
Mary: I'm sorry you didn't get to find the ape man, Al.
145
Eric: You're forgetting something.
146
If this goes as planned, we'll get to meet a dragon.
147
And you'll get to be a hero to the Woolymen.
148
That's something, right?
149
Al: Woah, yeah, I totally forgot about the dragon.
150
C'mon, guys! We can't sit around here, we have to meet the dragon!
151
Frida: It's... real.
152
Eric: Are you Valamus?
153
Valamus: Hmph... huff...
154
Eric: Come to think of it, we never found out if he could talk.
155
Valamus: Speak... Yes, I can speak...
156
Though my words have grown labored of late...
157
Al: Are you sick? What do we have to do?
158
Valamus: Nothing... nothing can be done...
159
Al: Wh-wha?
160
Valamus: I have lived... countless ages.
161
I have seen my friends... live and die so many times.
162
Now I have no... time left.
163
Frida: I think...
164
I think he's dying of old age.
165
Mary: If he dies, won't the village go cold?
166
Valamus: Yes... it pains me to say...
167
The Balophim people have been... so kind.
168
Mary: Frida, do something!
169
Frida: My magic can't help.
170
I- I can't help.
171
Al: Wait, no-no-no, you can't die!
172
If you die, then... that means I failed again.
173
Valamus: I see such ambition in you... young one.
174
Let me tell you something I have learned... in my eons of life.
175
The people who really love you... will not expect you to do great deeds.
176
That is why I die... with no regrets.
177
I know that my people would love me... whether I give them warmth of the body...
178
...or only of heart.
179
Eric: Vitruvius sent us here to find out what happened.
180
What would you like us to tell him?
181
Valamus: Tell him not to despair... for while today may be cold, and tomorrow...
182
...beyond that... there is hope.
183
Valamus handed over the dragon egg.
184
Eric: An egg... another dragon will be born.
185
Al: Wait...
186
Can I be the one to give it to them?
187
Can you just...
188
Let me have this one?
189
Eric: Of course.
190
Valamus: Thank you so much... for coming here.
191
I am grateful that I have gotten to meet wonderful new people... to the very end.
192
You have given me warmth... in my last moments.
193
Mary: *sniff* *hic* *sob*
194
Frida: He's gone.
195
Eric: It... just got cold.
196
Let's head back. We should let them know what happened.
197
Vitruvius: It is cold.
198
Al: I'm so sorry. I- there was nothing I could do.
199
Vitruvius: Young man... the weight of all our lives is not on you alone.
200
Al: He told us to tell you... that there is still hope.
201
Al handed over the Dragon Egg.
202
Vitruvius: He trusted you with this...
203
He must have seen something in you.
204
I am deeply sorry. I should never have given you such a burden.
205
You did nothing to deserve it.
206
Eric: Will you be okay now? What about the cold?
207
Vitruvius: It will be a difficult time. But do not worry. You have done far more than your responsibility for us.
208
Let us honor you for your courage.
209
This is a relic that has been with my people for many generations.
210
Cherish it.
211
Obtained a Thorn of Benelohim!
212
Al: Th-Thank you.
213
Mary: I thought of something!
214
You did it Al!
215
Al: Huh?
216
Eric: I think she means that you lived up to your parents' hopes for you.
217
You got to do something great.
218
Just like you wanted.
219
Al: Oh. Yeah.
220
But... I don't know if it was worth it...
