The Bard is a jack of all trades able to cast all kinds of magic. They gain a level of both arcane and divine magic every time they reach an odd numbered character level, and can learn spells in the same way as the Wizard and Cleric. They gain excellent charisma and spirit, and are pretty good in all of the other scores, allowing them to fill a wide variety of roles. Additionally, they gain the ability to add their charisma to the power of their spells.
