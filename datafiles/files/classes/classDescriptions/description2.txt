The Thief is a master dungeoneer and a highly mobile warrior. They can steal items from enemies, which can help greatly in obtaining equipment and treasure, and they can pick locks saving the effort of obtaining the key. They can also use the hide power to stealthily avoid attack and deal increased damage. They gain excellent agility and dexterity, but their equipment access is poor, so they are less well suited to battle than other classes.
