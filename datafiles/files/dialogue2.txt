Frida: C'mon, let's get a room.
2
Al: I'm gonna wait outside.
3
Eric: Why don't you watch our stuff, then? Thieves are a problem around here.
4
Al: Fine.
5
They actually trusted me with their stuff.
6
Maybe I'll take it when I ditch 'em...
8
...
8
What the-
9
Hey! Get back here with that!!
10
Eric: Al, are you okay? I heard yelling.
11
Al: Quick! After that kid! He took the food bag!
12
???: !!!
13
Frida: No! Not the food!
14
Eric: Gotcha!
15
Ya know you shouldn't take other people's stuff.
16
Frida: There's no use reasoning with it. It's clearly feral.
17
Eric: That's a terrible thing to say!
18
???: ...
19
...
20
...
21
...sorry...
22
Eric: See? He even has good manners.
23
...
24
Eric: Are you still there?
25
You look really hungry.
26
???: *nods*
27
Eric: Here. Take this.
28
Do you want a place to stay? I mean, just for tonight.
29
Frida: What!? But there's only two beds!
30
Eric: It's okay. Al and I'll sleep on the floor.
31
Al: Pardon me?
32
Eric: C'mon, Al. It's good karma.
33
Al: Argh! I can't believe the stuff I let you talk me into.
34
Eric: Great! So, what's your name?
35
???: ...name?
36
Eric: Yeah. You do have a name, right?
37
???: My name is...
38
...Mary.
39
Eric: Mary, huh? That's an unusual name for a boy.
40
Frida: It's probably a gang name. From the streets.
41
Mary: ...
42
Al: I think you guys are missing the obvious explanation.
43
Have you considered that, well...
44
...*he* might be a...?
45
Eric: Urk, uhh...
46
Mary, are you, by any chance a...
47
...girl?
48
Mary: ...
49
...
50
...
51
*nods*
52
Eric: Ahh! I'm so sorry!
53
Al: Woah, that's embarrassing.
54
Eric: It's not that you don't look like a girl! You're very... radiant!
55
I just... didn't get a good look at you.
56
Frida: Who cares if it's a boy or a girl. An urchin is just an urchin.
57
Eric: You can come with us, for now, okay?
58
Mary: ...Okay...
59
Late that night...
60
Al: Looks like they're asleep...
61
Time to take off, before things get any weirder.
62
Ah!
63
Mary: *gasp*
64
Al: Mary!? What are you doing!?
65
Mary: Let me go!
66
I was... gonna take as much stuff as I could and run away.
67
But you caught me.
68
Al: Mary... How could you do that after Eric was so nice to you?
69
Mary: ...
70
Cause I'm gonna be hungry again later...
71
What were you doing, anyway?
72
Al: Me? I had to pee...
73
Mary: Then hurry and go.
74
Al: Fine. I was gonna...
75
...well...
76
I was gonna take as much stuff as I could and run away.
77
Mary: But didn't you just say...?
78
Al: Yeah. I did.
79
But it's different for me!
80
I've never had a single friend. I've never been able to trust anyone.
81
I can't just let them push me around! I have to look out for myself!
82
Mary: I don't really have any friends either.
83
Al: Oh...
84
Mary: Yeah...
85
Al: So, fine. I'm a terrible person. What do you want me to say?
86
Don't look at me like that.
87
Mary: ...I kinda like you.
88
Al: Hm? Oh, I guess we do have a lot in common.
89
Being terrible. And having no friends. And being homeless...
90
You know Frida? The really mean girl?
91
Mary: *nods*
92
Al: She's homeless, too, in a way.
93
Maybe we should stick together, huh? And as long as Eric is willing to look after us...
94
...he can tag along, too.
95
Mary: So I can come? Forever?
96
Al: Sure. Why not?
97
Frida: Wait a second!
98
Eric: Do you guys have to talk so loud?
99
Frida: Eric, say something! She can't come with us!
100
Eric: ...Sorry, Frida, it looks like you've been out-voted.
101
You're gonna have a little sister.
102
Al: So you'll help me and Mary find homes?
103
Eric: Yeah. I promise.
104
Now everyone go back to bed.
105
Mary: Wait! Al, don't forget to pee!
106
Al: That was a lie, Mary.
107
Mary: ...oh.
108
Eric: Don't eat too much, Mary. We have to get going.
109
Al: Get going? To do what, exactly?
110
Eric: Hehe. That always seems to be the question, huh?
111
My only idea is, we could cross into North Elta.
112
I figure, the farther we get from home, the less likely we are to be tracked.
113
???: I see you have wisdom to spare, young ones.
114
But your understanding of your situation remains a weakness.
115
Al: Yikes! Who are you?
116
Frida: Nice try, buster, but I know better than to trust creepy strangers!
117
???: A stranger, am I?
118
Frida: Oh! We can trust him, he's a friend of my dad's!
119
???: Quiet now, Frida, for you know secrets which are vital to keep.
120
Frida: Oh. Okay. Sorry.
121
Elk: In my work, I am called Elk.
122
Al: Codenames. Awesome. Can I be Cobra?
123
Elk: Be who you like. It is of no concern.
124
Cobra: Sweet.
125
Elk: Frederick and I spent our days in pursuit of the Lord's Army.
126
Their true nature seems to be a dark secret, closely guarded.
127
Mary: He talks funny. Are you getting this?
128
Frida: Hush, Mary. This is how grownups talk.
129
Cobra: Who's Frederick, again?
130
Eric: Frida's dad.
131
Cobra: Oh, yeah.
132
Elk: In fact, I have come here to conduct research in how they may be defeated, and your parents may be freed, Frida.
133
I ask that you and your friends accompany me to Lon Hirodine's great library.
134
Frida: Okay.
135
Elk: This place is a safe haven for us.
136
Cobra: Alright, so what do you need us for? Some spec-ops mission? I bet it'll be really dangerous, huh?
137
Elk: From you, Cobra, I need nothing.
138
Cobra: Wha-? So my codename is... pointless?
139
Al: I guess I'll only ever just be Al...
140
Elk: Eric, you are a knight in training, yes?
141
Eric: Yeah.
142
Elk: Excellent. El Trice has been made safe again. My wife watches over house Tricius in Frederick's absence.
143
I trust that you shall see Frida home safely.
144
Frida: Wait, what? So we're...
145
...going home?
146
Elk: A relief, is it not?
147
Frida: Yeah. Of course. It's just...
148
Eric: What about Frida's parents?
149
Elk: Don't be silly, Eric. You are only children.
150
Let the grownups take it from here.
151
Al: Eric...
152
wh- what about me and Mary?
153
Mary: ...
154
Eric: Hey, Mr. Elk? Uhh... here's the thing...
155
I kinda told Al and Mary that I'd help them out. They're in a bit of a tough spot.
156
Elk: A lesson in chivalry, Eric.
157
Should you find yourself breaking a promise,
158
Your failure came the moment the promise was made.
159
You cannot find homes for these friends of yours. The longer you take to accept that, the deeper your shame will be when you finally give up.
160
Eric: ...
161
Frida: What!? But he didn't even get a chance!
162
Eric: Be quiet.
163
He's right. I'm just a kid. I can't help you.
164
Let's go, Frida.
165
I'm sorry, Alamand.
166
I'm *hic* sorry, Mary.
167
Al: I'm sorry, too.
168
I can't believe I was really starting to trust you.
169
Mary: WAIT!!!
170
Elk: Hush, little boy, this is a library.
171
Mary: Eric, I know I'm stupid, but I still believe you.
172
Eric: I made a promise I couldn't keep.
173
Al: You're an idiot, Eric.
174
You... didn't even try. And already you're letting this old guy tell you to give up.
175
Elk: I cannot let harm come to Frida. I promised her father.
176
I made a promise I intend to keep.
177
Al: Well, then...
178
It's your promise against Eric's.
179
What do you say?
180
Eric: I...
181
...I say...
182
I'm in a winning mood.
183
Mary: What does that mean?
184
Al: It means he's taking our side.
185
Frida: Eric...
186
Elk: Fine, then. I don't plan to restrain you. Do what you wish.
187
Just...
188
Be safe. Okay?
189
Eric: Of course.
190
Al: No promises.
191
Frida: I... I guess I'm going too, then.
192
Mary: Eric... thanks.
193
Eric: Umm... one last thing...
194
Any tips on where to go?
195
Elk: Honestly, the nerve. To ask for my help in an endeavor I so thoroughly disapprove of...
196
...but if you must.
197
Make for Eladar Manta.
198
Frida: Woah. The religious capital of Elta?
199
Elk: Yes. You may find obstacles gaining entry. But, if your resolve is true, you will find a way. And there is no safer place.
200
Eric: So. We make for the bridge, and leave into northern Elta.
201
Al: So what are we doing now?
202
Eric: Weren't you listening? We're traveling to Eladar Manta.
203
Al: That's not what I meant. What are we DOING?
204
Eric: Oh...
205
We're going to find Frida's parents.
206
And we're going to find real homes for you and Mary.
207
Al: I just wanted to hear it again. To make sure you were still serious.
208
You heard it too, right Mary?
209
Mary: *nods*
210
Frida: Eladar Manta...
211
This is the first time I've seen it in person. It's beautiful.
212
Al: Don't get your hopes up. Elk said we'd have a hard time getting in.
213
Eric: Let's try to be optimistic.
214
Excuse me?
215
Guard: Who goes there?
216
Eric: I am Eric, Son of Ulrich.
217
Frida: I am Frida, Daughter of Frederick.
218
Al: I'm Alamand. You... wouldn't know my dad.
219
Mary: I'm Mary.
220
Eric: So, yeah...
221
A man calling himself Elk said we should come here.
222
Guard: The only referral that can grant you access to Eladar Manta is that of God himself.
223
Frida: What do you mean?
224
Guard: You must each have great faith in Him. Once He approves of you, the way will be marked with symbols of your worthiness.
225
Al: Argh! That doesn't help at all!
226
Frida: I have great faith! Can they be... my guests or something?
227
Guard: You have far yet to go.
228
Frida: What?
229
Al: Well this is a bust. I'm not religious at all.
230
And something tells me Mary couldn't even spell 'faith.'
231
Mary: It starts with an F.
232
Al: You're learning.
233
Frida: I don't think it's that simple...
234
Symbols of our worthiness...
235
What could that mean?
236
Eric: Maybe we have to find something? A physical object?
237
Al: Well? Are we on the right track?
238
Guard: ...
239
Al: Right. Where's the fun if he just tells us?
240
Eric: Maybe if we visit a church, someone there'll be more forthcoming.
241
What? You can't afford it? How are you that broke?
242
I hope humans like shopping!
243
Fey Guardian: Halt! What business have you in the valley of the fey?
244
Al: Can you guys think of anything?
245
Frida: No we don't.
246
Fey Guardian: Then be gone!
247
Fey Guardian: Halt! What business have you in the valley of the fey?
248
Mary: Stop stealing dreams!
249
Frida: Shut it, Mary!
250
Eric: We're here to discuss the situation in Ephemera.
251
Fey Guardian: If you are here to grovel and beg for forgiveness, then enter.
252
Al: Uh... sure.
253
Mary: Where are we now?
254
Eric: Ephemera. I'm actually not used to such a small town.
255
Al: Does anyone else feel like there's something off here?
256
Frida: Yeah, everyone's acting really weird. Let's ask around.
257
Innkeeper: Can I help you kids?
258
Al: What's going on here? Everyone seems... spooked.
259
Innkeeper: Oh, that... is it so noticeable?
260
Eric: It was pretty much the first thing we noticed.
261
Innkeeper: It's nothing you should be concerned about, but...
262
...starting just recently, no one here has been able to dream.
263
Al: What? You can't... dream?
264
Innkeeper: That's right. We asked around, and no one here's had a dream in weeks.
265
Frida: How's that even possible?
266
Innkeeper: We suspect the fey from the Misty Valley to the east.
267
Drunkard: Those blasted pixies! They stole our good sleep!
268
Mary: How can you steal dreams?
269
Frida: It could be some sort of curse. We'll have to investigate further.
270
Mary: EEEEK!
271
Eric! Eric! Tiny people! Tiny people!!
272
Fairy: Haven't you ever seen a fairy before?
273
Next you'll say you've never seen a Unicorn!
274
Al: Yeah, I probably will.
275
Eric: Do you know anything about Ephemera? They say they can't dream, and they think it's because of you.
276
Fairy: Huh? But I don't know anyone from Ephemera!
277
Eric: Not you specifically, the Fey in general.
278
Fairy: Oh. Well then you'll have to talk to Tinonia, the Queen of the Fey Court.
279
She's pretty general.
280
Eric: Excuse me, are you Queen Tinonia?
281
Tinonia: Yes, and by what folly have humans been allowed in my presence?
282
Frida: I am Frida, Daughter of Frederick, and I am not some peasant!
283
Tinonia: I do not know you, or your father. Now speak your peace before my patience runs out!
284
Eric: We've come from Ephemera to...
285
...grovel?
286
Tinonia: Ah, so you've returned the captive?
287
Eric: Captive?
288
Al: We're here to see if we can get their dreams turned back on. Does that captive have something to do with it?
289
Tinonia: Of course! Some weeks ago, a human from Ephemera came to these woods and kidnapped one of our own using a gruesome weapon.
290
Then he stored her away in a glass prison, and fled the woods!
291
Since then, no humans have been allowed beyond the threshold of the valley without cause.
292
Eric: A glass... prison? That he could run away with?
293
Al: And a gruesome weapon.
294
Frida: Yeah, I'm kind of having trouble forming a mental image.
295
Tinonia: If you are going to help, the captor's name is Percival, and the captive is called Ariadne.
296
Eric: How do you know the kidnapper's name?
297
Tinonia: Simple. He left this at the scene of the crime.
298
Frida: It's a composition book. Like from school.
299
Eric: And it has "Percy" written on the cover.
300
Al: This is just getting more confusing.
301
Eric: Don't worry. We'll get her back. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
302
Mary: C'mon! We have to help Ariadne!
303
Eric: Wait. Can we take that with us?
304
Tinonia: If it will help you find the scoundrel, then certainly.
305
Eric took the composition book.
306
Boy: Hey! My notebook! Give it here!
307
Eric handed over the composition book.
308
Eric: Is your name Percival?
309
Percy: Yeah. I'm Percy.
310
Al: Do you, by any chance, like to play in the Misty Valley?
311
Percy: ...What's this about? Who are you guys?
312
Eric: I'm Eric. And don't worry, you're not in trouble. Probably.
313
Did you happen to catch a little fairy in that net not too long ago?
314
Frida: And by any chance did you trap it in a jar?
315
Percy: Maybe.
316
Al: There's your gruesome weapon and glass prison. I can't believe how dramatic those Fey can be.
317
Eric: Well that was easy. 
318
The fey are worried about her and want her to come home. So just hand over the jar and we won't have to tell your parents.
319
Percy: But I don't know where she is!
320
Frida: What!? But you said-
321
Percy: I said "maybe." And she got away before I got back to town.
322
Al: She got away?
323
Percy: Yeah, I opened the jar to ask her name, but she flew away.
324
I dropped it and went after her, but she was too fast.
325
Maybe.
326
Eric: Where were you when this happened?
327
Percy: Still in the valley.
328
Eric: If she didn't return home she must have gotten lost in the woods.
329
Let's go back to the Fey Court and let them know.
330
Tinonia: So you've returned. You struck down the evildoer and found Ariadne?
331
Frida: Well the evildoer was a little boy, so we didn't "strike him down."
332
Eric: And more to the point, he said that she got away while they were still in the valley, so she must've gotten lost on her way home.
333
Tinonia: Nonsense! A fairy could never get lost in the valley.
334
Unless...
335
Eric: Unless what?
336
Tinonia: Unless she somehow wandered into the part of the valley where the mist is the most thick.
337
She could still be there, trapped by monsters, and blinded by the mist.
338
Mary: ...monsters?
339
Eric: She's in danger, then! We have to hurry!
340
Frida: Wait, your majesty, you should send a rescue team!
341
Tinonia: The Fey are no match for any sort of monsters. I leave this to you.
342
Al: What!? That's cowardly.
343
Al: I can't believe they would send four kids to go do their dirty work in a monster infested forest.
344
Frida: Come to think of it, they thought Percy was really threatening. Maybe they just can't tell how old humans are?
345
Eric: That could be...
346
Now we have to get going.
347
Mary: To where the mist is the thickest...
348
Mary: I see something up ahead...
349
Al: Really? I can't see a thing in this mist.
350
Eric: She's right. There's some ruins.
351
Frida: Let's be careful.
352
Mary: Wait... I think I heard something.
353
Eric: I hear it, too. Let's have a look around.
354
???: EEEEEEEK!!
355
Mary: Don't scream! We're here to help you.
356
Eric: Are you Ariadne?
357
Ariadne: *sniff* Y-yes.
358
Al: Are you alright?
359
Ariadne: No! Not one bit!
360
I've been here for weeks!
361
Stuck sleeping on twigs and eating bugs.
362
Which is what fairies sleep on and eat anyway, but the atmosphere is very dejecting...
363
Eric: No worries, we'll take you back to the Fey Court right away.
364
Ariadne: ...and the worst part is the ferocious creature that lives here that I have to hide from.
365
Mary: Creature?
366
Al: Oh, relax. Knowing these fairies, it's probably a cat or a bird or something.
367
Mary: CREATURE!
368
The party is attacked by a giant spider. Upon defeating it:
369
Al: Okay, I admit, that thing was pretty ferocious.
370
Eric: Let's not wait for backup to come for it. C'mon, Ariadne.
371
Ariadne: Yes! Let's go!
372
Ariadne hopped into Eric's pocket.
373
Upon exiting to the world map:
374
Ariadne: You guys are cute for humans.
375
Al: I get that a lot.
376
Frida: What do you mean "for humans?"
377
Ariadne: Most humans are freakish and scary looking!
378
Frida: Honestly, do fairies have NO manners?
379
Eric: We have been getting mouthed-off at a lot, recently.
380
Ariadne: I'm not mouthing off! I'm saying you DON'T look like that!
381
Besides, I was just trapped in a room alone with a spider for WEEKS.
382
I think I've earned the right to be a little grumpy.
383
Al: That's nothing. I lived in a theater for years. And that place was crawling with ghosts and stuff.
384
And what about Mary? How long was she living on the street?
385
Mary: Hm? Well lemme think...
386
I got away from the orphanage when I was 7.
387
And since then it's been about...
388
5 years.
389
Ariadne: Woah. 5 years?
390
Eric: Wait, that makes you uhh...
391
Frida: 12 years old.
392
Eric: Are you sure you're that old, Mary? You look way younger.
393
Maybe you're remembering wrong.
394
Mary: I know how old I am.
395
Eric: No offense, you're just so small.
396
Mary: Hmph...
397
Ariadne: There's nothing wrong with being small.
398
Actually, you look pretty big from my point of view.
399
Mary: Thanks.
400
Ariadne: Don't you think big people are scary?
401
Mary: I dunno.
402
Ariadne: Think about it! Little people like us get pushed around by big people all the time.
403
I'd be nervous if I were you, with that big sword guy hanging around.
404
Eric: Hang on, I would never do anything to hurt Mary!
405
Ariadne: Sure, you say that now.
406
Eric: Mary, don't listen to her.
407
Mary: Mmm...
408
Ariadne: Your majesty! I'm baaaaaack!
409
Tinonia: Extraordinary! To think humans could be capable of such acts of courage!
410
Take this as thanks.
411
Obtained the Cold Mist Tome!
412
Eric: Don't mention it.
413
Frida: I'm ready to leave this place behind us. I've never been spoken to so rudely.
414
Al: Don't forget Ephemera. We need you to turn their dreams back on, remember?
415
Tinonia: If you want to restore their dreams, feel free to go into the dreamscape and do so.
416
Eric: The dreamscape?
417
Tinonia: The world of dreams. You can enter right through here. But the danger is great.
418
Al: Not too great to switch them off in the first place, huh?
419
Eric: There's no convincing them. We'll have to do it ourselves.
420
Frida: So this is the dreamscape.
421
Mary: This is so metaphysical.
422
...
423
Eric: You're right, I'm just...
424
...surprised you're the one who said it.
425
Frida: Let's be careful.
426
Frida: Look. That must be that monster stopping Ephemera from getting their dreams.
427
Al: It doesn't look too friendly. We'll have to fight.
428
Mary: B-b-b-
429
But it's huge!
430
Eric: Yeah, I don't know if this is a good idea.
431
Al: C'mon! Forget what that fairy said.
432
Sure it's big, but it's four on one!
433
We can take it for sure!
434
But that won't work if we're still having trust issues.
435
Eric: Mary, I... I know I'm bigger than you.
436
But I would never want you to get hurt. The thought of doing something like that just... makes me sick.
437
Please trust me. I'm begging you.
438
Mary: ...
439
...
440
...
441
Okay. I trust you.
442
...
443
Just don't cry about it!
444
Eric: I'm not!
445
Al: Then what are we waiting for?
446
Al: Close one.
447
Mary: Huff... Huff...
448
Frida: I don't even want to think about what would happen to my soul if I died in a place like this.
449
Eric: Let's not waste anymore time.
450
'You coming, Mary?
451
Mary: Yup!
452
Tononia: You did it? Well then go back to Ephemera and see if it worked.
453
Ariadne: Wait! Can I say something.
454
Al: Shoot.
455
Ariadne: Sorry for being so mean.
456
I actually learned a lot from you.
457
You came and helped me when the fey were just gonna leave me there 'cause they were too scared.
458
And then you went in there and beat up Dreamcatcher.
459
I guess... we don't have to be scared just because we're small. If we work together, it's almost like we're human-sized.
460
Al: Isn't that sweet. Everyone learned a lesson.
461
Frida: I hope you also learned something about showing respect to important people who are generous with their time.
462
Ariadne: Umm... nope. No clue what you're talking about.
463
Frida: Hmph! Do you have any idea who you're talking to? Look me in the eye!
464
Al: Okay, so not EVERYONE learned a lesson.
465
Still, I'd say we broke even.
466
Eric: Let's get back to Ephemera before we regress any farther.
467
Eric: Hey, are the dreams back?
468
Innkeeper: As a matter of fact they are! I for one had a great dream last night where I was on a beach with my ex-wife and she was-
469
Uh-hmrm, actually, you'll learn about that when you're older.
470
Mary: That was us!
471
Frida: Mary, it's not polite to brag!
472
Innkeeper: You did what!? Oh, the dreams, yes. Very well done! You're too young for free drinks so I guess I'll just have to give you this.
473
Obtained a Thorn of Benelohim!
474
Mary: What's this thing?
475
Eric: I think it may be what we're looking for.
476
Frida: Thank you sir! It was no trouble.
477
Al: If only he knew...
478
Frida: Father, my friends and I have a question.
479
Priest: Speak it then, daughter, for the Lord has answers.
480
Frida: We are trying to enter Eladar Manta. We were told that if we had faith, the way would be marked with symbols of our worthiness.
481
And, well, we can’t figure out what that means.
482
Priest: Remember, while works without faith are empty but true, faith without works is an equally empty lie.
483
Mary: I don’t get it, what’s he saying?
484
Frida: He means that just having faith isn’t enough, we need to do good things, too.
485
Priest: Indeed. You are well studied.
486
As for the symbols of your worthiness…
487
Alamand: We thought maybe he was talking about something specific we have to find.
488
Priest: Again, a perceptive reading.
489
Entry to Eladar Manta requires that you present a Thorn of Benelohim.
490
Mary: A horn of banana-what now?
491
Frida: Benelohim is the Son of God.
492
Thorns were used to torture him right before he was killed.
493
These thorns are still around, and they are very valuable and sacred artifacts.
494
Priest: Splendid! Perhaps you could join the church yourself when you come of age!
495
Frida: Aww, well, I could if I wanted, but…
496
Priest: Most of the thorns are accounted for.
497
But if your works are good and your intentions pure…
498
...perhaps you will find what you seek.
499
Eric: So we’re just going to travel Elta helping people and hope we find thorns?
500
Frida: Well…
501
Yes?
502
Al: It seems like a longshot, but we don’t really have anything better to try.
503
Eric: And we can keep looking for information on Frida’s parents along the way.
