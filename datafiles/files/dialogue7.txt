So, you think adventuring is the life for you?
2
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Adam. They call me Adam the Hawk.
3
I've been an adventurer for a pretty long time now, so yeah, I kinda know what I'm talking about.
4
The first thing you'll need is a party.
5
You can't go wrong with the default, but if you're feeling confident, feel free to customize!
6
Hmm... okay, okay.
7
Yeah, that looks pretty good!
8
Well, I don't want to keep you all day, and the best way to learn is by doing! So just a few more things.
9
I've already got your first quest for you. It's pretty simple, all you have to do is meet me at my place in Hearthaven.
10
It's across the sea to the East, so it'll be a bit of a challenge to get there, but I think you can do it.
11
Here's a tip: be sure to talk to everyone you meet! The common folk are full of great information.
12
I think that's all you need for now...
13
Oh yeah! Just one more thing!
14
Remember that whatever happens out there...
15
You can never go back.
16
Mayor: Oh dear! Oh my! Oh, this is terrible!
17
My darling granddaughter Ariadne has been kidnapped!
18
The vicious and savage Mole Men of the north are responsible, and they demand a ransom that I cannot possibly afford!
19
Oh, if only some brave knight errant would save her! I would give them a grand reward! I would even give away my prized sailing ship the Hyperion!
20
Ariadne: You sure are strong! Are you here to save me?
21
Gosh, that sure is nice of you!
22
Aridane came along with you!
23
Mayor: Ah! Ariadne! You're back! It's a miracle!
24
How can I every repay you? Ah, yes, I know! My sailing ship, the Hyperion, is yours!
25
The Hyperion is docked outside of town, whenever you want to use it.
26
Adam: Woah, you guys made it.
27
I mean, yeah, of course you did! Haha! Have trouble finding the place?
28
???: Hello? Who's this?
29
Adam: Oh, sorry, that was rude of me. These are the new adventurers I was telling you about.
30
And this is my girlfriend, Maria.
31
Maria: Nice to meet you.
32
Adam: You don't have to hang around, we're talking about some really boring stuff.
33
...
34
Is she gone?
35
Okay, so here's what we're doing next.
36
You know the fortress on the island to the west of here?
37
It's been sealed away since forever, but I've finally figured out how to get in.
38
Legends say that there's a gemstone in there called the Star Ruby. It's supposed to be the most beautiful and priceless gem in the whole world.
39
...so she's probably gonna like it, right?
40
Uhh... sorry. I know it's selfish of me. But you can keep all the other treasure in there!
41
C'mon! I'll race you there!
42
Maria: Oh, is he gone already?
43
He didn't even say goodbye!
44
If you ever catch up with him, tell him to be safe, okay?
45
This adventuring stuff really scares me.
46
???: ...Friends of yours?
47
I see. You will be pleased to know that he put up a good fight. But in the end, he was no match.
48
Excuse me, I should introduce myself.
49
Ephemeris: I am Ephemeris. And this young man could not conceive of the powers he was toying with.
50
I gather that you are angry with me. And soon, your anger will yield to grief.
51
But do not despair. You will not suffer my fate, of bearing the burden of such sorrow for years beyond count.
52
Even if you survive this day, soon, everything will begin anew. All of the misery and woe will be washed away in clear waters.
53
And I will go back, to a kinder time.
54
Wouldn't you do the same? Seeing now what you've seen?
55
...
56
It doesn't matter. I've made up my mind.
57
Victoria! Bring them their end!
58
I've had enough of battle.
59
Victoria: Well? You ready?
60
I'll make beautiful corpses out of you!
61
???: Hm? What's the matter? Expecting someone else?
62
...
63
No? Man, whatever.
64
Alexander: I am Alexander, King of Thieves!
65
You will never have my silver key!
66
Come on, fellas! Let's light 'em up!
67
???: Finding your way here is no mean feat.
68
Ortega: I am Ortega. Mightiest of the generals of Ephemeris.
69
I am the guardian of the final key to his sanctuary.
70
But you will never pass me.
71
My light of vengeance will reduce you to ashes before you can trouble Ephemeris.
72
Ortega: You-
73
You may strike me down-
74
Ack!
75
But Ephemeris will destroy you! You will not stand a chance!
76
Guh...
77
Ephemeris: Nothing short of divine providence could have delivered you here today.
78
You've survived long odds again and again.
79
You have become great adventurers. No one can deny that.
80
But it doesn't matter.
81
You are too late.
82
The machine is complete, and now my doorway to the past will open.
83
You should watch carefully.
84
The final moments of history.
85
Ephemeris: Welcome! Welcome to the end of time!
86
Pass through these corridors if you dare, but what awaits you is no ordinary peril!
87
In this darkness, it is not merely your body which breaks down.
88
The forces that bind your very cells will be overwhelmed.
89
The atoms themselves will split, the protons and neutrons will decay.
90
Strings will snap, membranes will rot, and all energy will be depleted.
91
Soon, bare logic will fail you. And you will be in a state of pure nonexistence beyond mere death.
92
But if your power is as great as mine, you will reach the other side.
93
Ephemeris: I cannot remember smiling before today. It has been so long.
94
I-
95
I'm back. In my own world.
96
Soon I will reunite with the feeling of love, and live out my days in peace.
97
Vespadia?
98
No, this land is called Eden, though I will meet the Vespadians soon, and I have met them already. Long, long ago.
99
...
100
Where is your despair? Do you believe that we have traveled mere years into the past and soon your time will return?
101
That all you need do is wait?
102
No, you know nothing about me.
103
These days of my youth were...
104
50,000 years ago!
105
You stand now in the time before history! In the time before cruelty and hate! Before my passion began!
106
It was the Vespadians who taught me to live forever. It was them who took me to the future, though it was not my wish.
107
And thanks to them, I had all the time I needed to find a way back.
108
And so it has come to pass.
109
But you cannot simply let me be happy.
110
You hate me for killing your friend.
111
You hate me for what I've achieved.
112
You hate me for winning. You hate me for being right.
113
And now I will give you your fight.
114
I will show you mercy, but only in death!
115
???: Ephemeris is dead.
116
But it doesn't matter.
117
He lives on in this time. And he has already been carried off to the future.
118
The cycle begins again. And again. And again.
119
I will take you to the time from whence you came.
120
Perhaps this time...
121
It will be different.
